TextMaster Coding Exercise - Checkout
=====================================

Hi! This is my honest solution for the Checkout exercise.
The specs should be self explanatory, no documentation is provided :).

This solution respects some points listed in the statement:

* the items can be scanned in any order,
* the checkout class can be initialized with any number of rules or no rules at all because the CEO and COO change their minds often ;).

Requirements
------------

* Ruby 2.2.2
* Bundler 1.10

Installation
------------

    bundle
    bin/rspec # To run all the specs, should be always green!
